      "passage": "<p><b>i)</b> Oprah Winfrey is thought of as the &#8221;Queen to Talk&#8221; since the mid-1980s. She is the first African American woman to host a national weekday talk show. In addition, Oprah is one of the richest and most powerful African American women in America. Her life story makes her success notable.</p><p><b>ii)</b> Oprah was born on January 29, 1954 on a farm in Kosciusko, Mississippi. She is the product of a brief meeting between a 20 year old Vernon Winfrey and an 18 year old Vernita Lee. Winfrey was in service when Oprah was born. Winfrey, apparently, learned of Oprah's birth when he received a printed baby announcement in the mail with a scribbled note: &#8221;Send clothes!&#8221; Vernita, Oprah's mother, left Mississippi soon after the birth of Oprah, leaving her young child with her maternal grandparents'. Oprah stayed at her grand parents' place until she was six years old.</p><p><b>iii)</b> As a young child, Oprah was raised on the farm in the rural tradition, receiving whippings and harsh chastisement as punishment for wrong doing. At the age of six, she moved to Milwaukee to live with her mother , who was working as a house cleaner. Rarely at home because of her work demands, Vernita had a difficult time providing for the emotional needs of the intelligent high - spirited Oprah.</p><p><b>iv)</b> Several Sources have relayed the creative ways Oprah tried to get her mother's attention. Once, her mother refused to buy her a new pair of eyeglasses- claiming that she couldn't afford it. Oprah then staged a fake burglary at her home. She said that she had been knocked unconscious, and during the ordeal her glasses had broken. Another time, she ran away from home. While on the street, she approached Aretha Franklin's limousine and convinced the singer that she was an abandoned child. Franklin is said to have given her &#36;100. Oprah's last antic involved her frantic attempt to keep a broken puppy. She created a tale about the brave puppy fending off robbers. She even added a bit of realism to the &#8221;scene&#8221; by tossing her mother's jewelry out of the window.</p><p><b>v)</b> At the age of nine, and for several years thereafter, Oprah was sexually abused by a teenaged cousin and then by other relatives and friends. She spoke openly about this on her talk show in 1991. At the time, she offered support and showed empathy to guests and viewers who had gone through similar painful experiences. In an article for Essence, she admitted that she couldn't free herself of the shame she felt until 1990, when she finally admitted, &#8221;I was not responsible for the abuse.&#8221; The molestation Oprah experienced in Milwaukee ended when, at the age of 14, she went to live with her father in Nashville.</p><p><b>vi)</b> While under the care of her father, she flourished and honed many of her communication skills. Oprah's life under her father's care was purposeful and disciplined. Because of this, she credits her father and the time she spent with him and his wife Zelma. She often likes to say her father 'saved' her life. In an interview for Washington Post magazine, she told Jill Nelson that if she hadn't been sent to her father, she would have gone in another direction.</p><p><b>vii)</b> In January 1984, Oprah took over the ailing television talk show AM Chicago. She instantly turned it into a smash hit Her earthy and down-home style won her large audience. In September of 1986, the Oprah Winfrey Show made its national debut Within five months, it was the third-highest-rated show on television behind the game shows of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy. In the same year, her show was ranked the number-one talk show. At that time, her show reached between 9 and 10 million people in 192 cities on a daily basis. Since then, Oprah and her show have received many Daytime Emmy awards.</p><p><b>viii)</b> Oprah's talent and energy have brought her success in other areas as well. For example, she is a successful publisher. In 2001, Book magazine named Oprah among the ten powerful people in publishing.</p><p align='right'><b><i>Adapted from the Skilled Reader (2010) Pearson Education, Inc</i></b></p>",
